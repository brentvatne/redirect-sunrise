## redirect-sunrise Chrome Extension

I like the Sunrise Calendar UI better than the Google Calendar UI, but I
always find myself typing calendar.google.com due to years of habit
forming. So I created this Chrome extension to redirect me to Sunrise
Calendar whenever I try to access Google Calendar directly via
calendar.google.com.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:brentvatne/redirect-sunrise.git`
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome and click `Load unpacked
   extension`, then select the directory that you just cloned.
